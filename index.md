Most Rivian web APIs use GraphQL. Learn more about GraphQL [here](https://graphql.org/).

## App API
This section contains information about the endpoints that the Rivian mobile app uses to fetch information about your vehicle or account. It also supports some controls, such as locking/unlocking, etc. See [App API](/app) for more information.

## Vehicle BLE API
The BLE API is used by the mobile app and keyfob. It supports the same controls found in the app API, but sends the commands directly to the vehicle over BLE instead of over the internet. See [Vehicle BLE API](/ble) for more information.

## Configurator Image API
The official website has an API for displaying images of different R1 configurations. See [Configurator API](/configurator/) for more information.
